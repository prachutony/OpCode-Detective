My contribution in this project is writing a python code to detect and correct an opcode error in a given x86 assembler code.

– Tools & technologies used: Python , x86 Assembler language (For comparison).

– From this project we have achieved to detect an opcode error made in the assembler code and a 65 Percent accuracy
in finding the perfect match of an opcode to replace with the incorrect opcode.
